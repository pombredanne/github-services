Install Notes
-------------

  1. **Url** should be your room url, for example https://youraccount.talkerapp.com/rooms/ROOM_ID
  2. **Token** should be on your settings page
  3. If **Digest** is checked, all commits will be compressed in one message

Note: replace https with http on the url if you're on the Free plan as it doesn't include enhanced security (SSL).
