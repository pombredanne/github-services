Open Build Service(OBS) is a distribution build system.

By enabling this hook, any Open Build Service instance (running version 2.5 or higher) will list
to push events. OBS Source Service will get execute for a defined package which will update
the sources in OBS and therefore rebuild automatically.

Install Notes
-------------

0. Prequire
   You need to have a package using a source service to update the sources.
   Check the OBS manual how to set this up.

1.  Create an authentification token for your account using "osc" commandline tool:
    # osc token --create

    You may already specify the package here
    # osc token --create _PROJECT_ _PACKAGE_

    That means the token can only be used for this package. It also means you do not have
    to specify it in github.com. Just using the token is enough.

    You can also use a comma separated list of tokens to trigger several obs builds.

2.  Enter your credentials at github.com
    - The token which got created (use "osc token" if you lost it)
    - optional: Modify the api url, if you do not use the openSUSE Build Service instance.
    - optional: Enter the project and package name in case you have a generic token.

3.  Make sure the "Active" checkbox is ticked, and click "Update Settings".
