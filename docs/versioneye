VersionEye is a notification system for software libraries. It notifies you about outdated dependencies in your repository.

Currently works for:

* Ruby (Bundler)
* Python (Pypi)
* Node.JS (NPM)
* Java (Maven, Gradle)
* PHP (Composer)
* Clojure (Lein)

Coming soon:

* CocoaPods
* Bower

This service hook will inform VersionEye every time you push to GitHub. On every push VersionEye will reparse your project file.
