Install Notes
-------------

Using the following url as an example:
http://logicalawesome.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8570-github/overview

  1. **Subdomain** is logicalawesome
  2. **Project Id** is 8570
  3. This service only supports project tokens
     (accepting patches for user-based tokens)
  4. **Private** determines whether changed files
     should be displayed (useful for public LH
     accounts and private GH repos)
  5. **Send Only Ticket Commits** ensures that the only commits sent to
     Lighthouse are ones with Lighthouse ticket codes.
